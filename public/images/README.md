This folder is for your images.

To use an image from this folder, reference it by its path starting from the `/images` folder.

For example, to use the image `public/images/hero-slide-1.jpg`, you would use the path `/images/hero-slide-1.jpg`.

You can then update the `imageUrl` in `src/lib/placeholder-images.json` to point to your new image file.
